# Deprecated because of the use the release of [Onboard Memory Manager](https://www.reddit.com/r/LogitechG/comments/k4nvm4/new_logitech_onboard_memory_manager/) - which is way better to reverse engineer


This is an attempt to replace the use of [Logitech G Hub](https://www.logitechg.com/en-eu/innovation/g-hub.html), an annoying proprietary software which doesn't make any memory modifications in microcontrollers present in Logitech devices, rather a polls a signal every *x* amount of time.

This has been designed for G-203 and can be run using;

```
make
```
Followed by `./G203`. This by no means is complete due the G-Hub being deprecated by Loge tech (being replaced by a better designed software).
